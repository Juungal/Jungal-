      Jungal Sanitation Services was founded in January 2025 by a dedicated group of friends with a shared vision for cleaner, healthier communities.
      <br><br>
      The initiative is led by Abdullahi Hashi and driven by a commitment to provide dignified sanitation solutions for both residential and commercial needs.
      <br><br>
      Our team believes that access to proper hygiene is not a privilege — it’s a right. We aim to empower communities by making clean, safe sanitation services available and accessible to all.
